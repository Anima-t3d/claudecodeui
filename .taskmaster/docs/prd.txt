Product Requirements Document: Claude Code UI - React Native Mobile Application

Executive Summary:
Convert the existing Claude Code UI web application into a native iOS mobile application using React Native, maintaining full feature parity with the web version while leveraging native mobile capabilities. The mobile app will connect to the existing Docker-based backend infrastructure.

Problem Statement:
Users need mobile access to Claude Code UI for on-the-go coding assistance and project management. The current web interface is not optimized for mobile devices, limiting accessibility and productivity when away from desktop environments.

Goals and Objectives:
1. Create a native iOS application with full feature parity to the web version
2. Implement secure credential storage using native iOS Keychain
3. Enable dynamic backend configuration for connecting to Docker containers
4. Provide native mobile UX with platform-specific optimizations
5. Maintain real-time WebSocket communication for chat functionality
6. Support offline capabilities with intelligent synchronization

User Stories:

As a developer, I want to:
- Configure my backend server URL on first launch so I can connect to my Docker instance
- Securely log in with my credentials stored in iOS Keychain
- Access all my projects with native scrolling and navigation
- Chat with Claude using a native mobile interface
- Browse and edit files with syntax highlighting
- Manage MCP servers and tool permissions
- Receive push notifications for long-running operations
- Use biometric authentication for quick access

Technical Requirements:

Architecture:
- React Native with TypeScript for type safety
